This is a log about the current state of programming:

date: 21-12-22

current objective: solve with convolver, use fft wd and grad fd

current state:
- "dirty" version where at many positions changed call to DFTProfile new to include two convolvers, FFT and FFT/Grad depending on local flag
- possible to use convolver with wd from FFT and fd from GradConvolver
- in principal solve starts but does crash at some point due to fluctuations at the boundaries
	- possible reasons: - bad implementation of fn gradient (dont know boundary values!)
				- density at the boundaries does not stay constant even when using FFT --> should it be like this??
- maybe makes sense to try v2 of local_functional_derivative in solver --> use gradients several time, should be worse!!
- still have two versions to calculate local functional derivative with
  individual terms
